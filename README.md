- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheBlackHat1960
- 👀 I’m interested in developing my own website; not sure yet wether I'm going to use Wordpress or Bootstrap or even both in combination.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript and PHP.  However I'm actually a Photographer so I'm also learning Photoshop 2021 or at least the new interface.  I'm also looking at the Affinity Suite too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that creates great websites with images
- 📫 How to reach me info@theblackhat.me
